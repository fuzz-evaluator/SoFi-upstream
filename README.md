# SoFi: Reflection-Augmented Fuzzing for JavaScript Engines

This repository holds the published (parts of the) SoFi code, originally made available on Google Drive via their [website](https://sites.google.com/view/sofi4js/souce-and-data). This artifact accompanies the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484823) that has been published at ACM CCS 2021.

Please note that the published code is incomplete and contains no documentation. The authors' verbatim [statement](https://sites.google.com/view/sofi4js/souce-and-data) is: "When I have time, I will  add documents. After I fully test the js engines, I will release the complete code."

We added this README file for clarification.
